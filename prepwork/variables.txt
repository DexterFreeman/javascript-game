trackShape:

Holds a copy of currentShape's default alignment before it is rotated,
so that in renderHeldShape, it matches the corresponding shape in the shapesArray
as when it is rotated, currentShape's values switch according to the rotation meaning
it would no longer match. 

isBlockPlaced: 

A boolean value used to track if a block has been placed or not, 
for the trackShape value. So that if a block has been placed - meaning currentBlock will
have changed, a new trackShape can be generated for the new currentShape. 

canSwitch:

A boolean value used to track whether the user can switch block or not,
this is to prevent the user from constantly switching between the two
same blocks

heldShape:

An array of the current held shape. It initialsed at blank as at the start
of the game, the user isn't holding any shape. 

canvas: 

The variable which contains the canvas element. 

context:

The 2d context of the canvas, used draw the squares, whole canvas, the grid
etc. 

gameBoardArrayHeight:

The height of the game board grid. Value: 20

gameBoardArrayWidth:

The width of the game board grid. Value: 12

currentShapeX:

The current shape's X coordinate. Used to move the current shape around
according to user input/rotation

currentShapeY: 

The current shapes Y coordinate. Also modified according to user input, 
rotation etc.

score:

The current score of the current game. 

level:

The level of the game. Increments by one for every 1000 score. Used to increase
the interval at which the current block will fall. 

coordinateArray:

Array used to represent the pixel coordinates for the canvas and splits into
a 20x12 grid. Used to draw squares into the correct position of the canvas. 

currentShape: 

The current tetris shape, represented by an array which contains the positioning of the squares. Then uses it's X and Y coordinates
to know it's current position in conjunction with the coordinateArray.

winOrLose:

A string value to track the current game state. It is either: "Playing", meaning the user has not lost or won. "Game Over": meaning
the user has lost the game. "Winner" meaning the user has won - occurs once the level is level 10. 

difficultyInterval: 

The interval to move the shape down at set amount of times, scales according to the level, the higher the level the quicker the blocks
move down.

possibleDirections: 

An object containing all of the possible directions a piece can move by, as well as an idle key. 

currentShapeDirection:

What the current direction of the current shape is, used to check for collisions and tracking where the shape will go. 

shapesArray:

The default positions for each possible shape in the game. Doesn't include rotated versions of any pieces. Used to randomly select
one of the indexs when creating a new shape. 

shapeColours:

The colours of each the shapes, the indexs of this array and the shapesArray match to their corresponding shape/colour.
